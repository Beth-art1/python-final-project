## 🧭 Overview
**SmartWaterApp** is a beginner-friendly **Streamlit web application** developed as part of the SDG-focused software project series.  
The app aligns with **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation)** by helping users:

- Track and visualize their **daily water usage**  
- View **simulated water quality insights**  
- Identify or suggest **clean water sources** in their area  

This project demonstrates the integration of **data analysis**, **visualization**, and **interactive app development** using Python.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Promote awareness of **responsible water consumption**.  
- Provide users with **interactive data insights** about water usage.  
- Build a **foundation for future AI- or IoT-based systems** in water management.
